Hi there, I am a master student at the School of Management, Fudan University(FDSM). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jiarong Xu](https://galina0217.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, under the supervision of Prof. [Jiyuan Tu](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/peoples/tujiyuan). Currently, I am also a research intern at Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence(BAAI), working on Multimodal LLMs and Agentic RL.

My current research interest primarily lies in building more capable multimodal agents and developing realistic RL environments. I am also interested in (high-dimensional) Statistics and interpretable Deep Learning. I am actively looking for PhD opportunities, free to contact me if there's any match!
